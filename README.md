# Human Activity Recognition Analysis and Web App

## Overview

This project focuses on Human Activity Recognition and includes Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, FastAPI, Gradio, and AWS. I developed a FastAPI API and deployed it on an AWS EC2 instance. The API predicts anthropometric characteristics and activity classes using KNN Regressor and Classifier pipelines. Additionally, I created a Gradio web app to interact with the API and display the output.
