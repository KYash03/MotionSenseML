# Human Activity Recognition Analysis and Web App

## Overview

This project focuses on Human Activity Recognition and includes Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, FastAPI, Gradio, and AWS. It involves the development and deployment of a FastAPI API on an AWS EC2 instance. The API predicts anthropometric characteristics and activity classes using KNN Regressor and Classifier pipelines. Additionally, I created a Gradio web app to interact with the API and display the output.

## Key Features

- **FastAPI API**: A FastAPI API is deployed on an AWS EC2 instance for predicting anthropometric characteristics and activity classes.
- **Gradio Web App**: A Gradio web app is designed to query the API and display the predictions in a user-friendly manner.
- **Accuracy Improvement**: The project achieves improved accuracy through hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.
